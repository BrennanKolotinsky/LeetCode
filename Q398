        To those who don't understand why it works. Consider the example in the OJ
{1,2,3,3,3} with target 3, you want to select 2,3,4 with a probability of 1/3 each.

2 : It's probability of selection is 1 * (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3 -- first run we are guaranteed, second there are two options, third there are three options and only a one third chance we will update!
3 : It's probability of selection is (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3
4 : It's probability of selection is just 1/3
